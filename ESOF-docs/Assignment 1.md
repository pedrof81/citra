**Brief description of the project**

As described in the Read Me file, Citra is an open-source and passion driven Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++ is written so builds can be actively maintained for Windows, Linux and OS X. At this time, Citra is able to boot many commercial games, most of which do not run to a playable state yet, but are being worked on every day to advance the project forward.


**Development Process**

>Citra is being developed as an hobby for several programmers and their work schedule on this Open Source Software Project is not very consistent. They are not supported by any company, therefore they don't have a deadline to implement features. Citra has a team of experiences developers that help (begginer/intermediate level) new contributtors with the standard level of code that is to be commited. They take a while to accept pull requests, so that they are certain that the pull has the quality they require, in order to avoid bugs or setbacks.
  >Since the contributes frequency is inconsistent, they can't use any industrial-standard engeneering process. They "are constantly working on new features" (said by one of the project leaders) so it would be considered an Incremental development process. However as they donÂ´t have any kind of deadlines and they only merge when they are sure the feature is operating correctly, we think they are also using a Slow programming process.
