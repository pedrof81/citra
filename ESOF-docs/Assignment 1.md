-Brief description of the project 

>Citra is an experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. It is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and OS X. Citra only emulates a subset of 3DS hardware, and therefore is generally only useful for running/debugging homebrew applications. At this time, Citra is even able to boot several commercial games! Most of these do not run to a playable state, but we are working every day to advance the project forward.

-Development Process

Incremental development and delivery
• Develop the system in increments and evaluate each
increment before proceeding to the development of the
next increment
• Evaluation done by user/customer proxy
• Some of the increments can be deployed to end-users
• The waterfall model can be followed in each increment
• Normal approach used in agile methods
