As described in the Read Me file, Citra is an open-source and passion driven Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++ is written so builds can be actively maintained for Windows, Linux and OS X. At this time, Citra is able to boot many commercial games, most of which do not run to a playable state yet, but are being worked on every day to advance the project forward.
