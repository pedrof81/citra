**Requirements**

Before we can start building a project it is essential that the team study the costumers and user needs so the team can have a clear statement and understanding of required properties of a solution to solve the problem.
The requirements for a system are the descriptions of what the system should do, the services that it provides and the constraints on its operation.Some of the problems that arise during the requirements engineering process are a result of failing to make a clear separation between these different levels of description.
We can divide them in two: user requirements and system requirements.

User requirements are statements of what services of the system is expected to provide to system users and the constraints under which it must operate.
System requirements are more detailed descriptions of the software systemâ€™s functions, services, and operational constraints.

Software system requirements are often classified as functional requirements or non-functional requirements.
Citra requires a 64-bit processor and OpenGl3.3 in order to emulate the 3DS.
The functional requirements for a system describe what the system should do. 
Non-functional requirements, as the name suggests, are requirements that are not directly concerned with the specific services delivered by the system to its users.

Requirement engineering processes may include four important high-level activities. These focus on assessing if the system is useful to the business (feasibility study), discovering requirements (elicitation and analysis), converting these requirements into some standard form (specification), and checking that the requirements actually define the system that the customer wants (validation).

Since Citra is not supported by any company they don't have a deadline to implement features, so how does the team decide on whether to implement a new feature or no? They implement features when they want or when the contributors have a feature that have the quality they require in order to avoid bugs or setbacks
For requirements elicitation we informal interview the developers and discover their requirements in their project site https://citra-emu.org/. 

Their main focus right now is to fix bugs that stop games from booting and bugs that crashes the program when running. While issues about specific games not booting are valid bugs, they are currently not interested in them unless there are several games which fail with the same or similar messages. There are too many non-working games right now to file individual issues for every one of them.
In future with low priority they intend to implement features like cheat code support, improve speed of cut scenes and support for smartphones, but right now, the main focus is getting the PC port stable.
Given the circumstances of this project (hobby, volunteers, low amount of time that developers have to work and inconsistent frequency of commits, specific knowledge about console hardware, emulation, among other areas) the reality of the new features is contributors of Citra contribute what they like and not always what is ideal.
