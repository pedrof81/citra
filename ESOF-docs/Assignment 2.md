Requirements: Introduction, Purpose/Scope, and Description
>Grade: 3pts
>Note: This is a generic introduction to requirements as well as requirements elicitation in the project (how is this done? How does the team decides on whether to implement a new features, etc. )

Before we can start building a project it is essential that the team study the costumers and user needs so the team can have a clear statement and understanding of required properties of a solution to solve the problem.
The requirements for a system are the descriptions of what the system should do, the services that it provides and the constraints on its operation.Some of the problems that arise during the requirements engineering process are a result of failing to make a clear separation between these different levels of description.
We can divide them in two: user requirements and system requirements.
User requirements are statements of what services of the system is expected to provide to system users and the constraints under which it must operate.
